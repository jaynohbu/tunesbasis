              The fundamental signal that constitutes music is the <strong>tone</strong>.
              It is a form of <strong>sensation</strong>, and can be analyzed in terms of
              <strong>pitch</strong>, <strong>loudness</strong>, <strong>duration</strong>,
              and <strong>timbre</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Pitch</strong> refers to the perceived height of sound, determined by
              the <em>frequency</em> of vibration — the greater the number of vibrations per
              second, the higher the pitch.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Loudness</strong>, or <strong>intensity</strong>, measures the
              <em>amplitude</em> of vibration, representing the strength or magnitude of the
              sound wave.
            </p>

            <p>
              The <strong>temporal structure</strong> of a musical signal consists of its
              <em>onset</em> (beginning), <em>offset</em> (end), and <em>tempo</em>, which
              together define the <strong>duration</strong> of sounds and form the basis of
              <strong>rhythm</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Finally, <strong>timbre</strong>, often described as the color or quality of
              sound, distinguishes one instrument or voice from another even when pitch and
              loudness are identical.
